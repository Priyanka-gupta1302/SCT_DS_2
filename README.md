# SCT_DS_2
# DESCRIPTION
For this project, I worked on the Titanic dataset from Kaggle, which is widely used for data analysis and machine learning practice.

# OBJECTIVES

Perform data cleaning: handle missing values, remove duplicates, and correct data types.

Explore data distribution and relationships between variables.

Identify patterns and trends in the dataset.

Visualize findings using charts and graphs.

# DASHBOARD INTERACTION


# KPIs for Task 02: Data Cleaning & EDA

##  Data Cleaning KPIs

1. Missing Values Handled (%) – Percentage of missing data imputed/removed.
2. Duplicate Records Removed – Number of duplicate rows detected and eliminated.
3. Data Type Consistency – All columns have correct data types (e.g., Age as numeric, Gender as categorical).
4. Outlier Detection & Treatment – Outliers identified and handled properly.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) KPIs

1. Survival Rate (%) – Overall percentage of passengers who survived.
2. Survival by Gender – % of male vs female survival.
3. Survival by Class (Pclass) – Trends of survival across 1st, 2nd, and 3rd class.
4. Age Group Analysis – Survival distribution across children, adults, and elderly.
5. Family Size Impact – Effect of SibSp (siblings/spouses) and Parch (parents/children) on survival.
6. Fare Influence – Relationship between fare paid and survival chances.
7. Embarkation Port Trends – Survival rate by port of embarkation (C, Q, S).

## Visualization KPIs

1. Number of Visualizations Created – Charts/plots generated (bar, histogram, pie, boxplot, heatmap).
2. Correlation Heatmap – Strength of relationships between variables.
3. Key Patterns Identified – Number of meaningful insights discovered.

# Key Insights (Titanic Dataset Example)

Survival rates by gender, class, and age group.

Impact of family size and fare price on survival.

Correlation between categorical and numerical variables.


# Final Conclusion

In this task, I performed data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset. The process involved handling missing values, removing inconsistencies, and preparing the dataset for analysis.

Through EDA, I explored the relationships between variables and identified key patterns:

Gender: Female passengers had a significantly higher survival rate compared to males.

Class: Passengers in 1st class had a much better chance of survival than those in 2nd or 3rd class.

Age: Children had a higher probability of survival compared to adults.

Fare: Higher ticket fares were generally associated with better survival chances.

Family size: Survival probability was higher for passengers traveling with small families compared to those traveling alone or with large families.


# Key Takeaway

The analysis highlights that social status (class), gender, and age played a major role in survival chances during the Titanic disaster. This task helped in strengthening concepts of data preprocessing, visualization, and pattern identification, which are essential skills in data science projects.

## This task provides hands-on practice in data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and data visualization – essential skills for data science projects.
